"""Dream — periodic memory consolidation for Claude Code.

Verbs:
  gate    SessionStart hook. Reads the hook payload on stdin and launches a
          consolidation when the time and session gates are both open.
  run     Launch one now, ignoring the gates.
  status  Print the gate state.
  restore Undo the last dream from the snapshot taken when it launched.
  reset   Clear this project's state so the gates reopen.

The gates live here rather than in the launched session because spinning up that
session is the cost they exist to avoid: a closed gate has to be a cheap process
exit, not a model call.

State lives in ~/.claude/dream-plugin-state/<project-slug>/, keyed by the same
slug Claude Code uses for the transcript directory. Memories are per-project, so
the gates are too — consolidating one project must not silence another.

Environment:
  DREAM_MIN_HOURS     hours between consolidations (default: 24)
  DREAM_MIN_SESSIONS  new sessions required (default: 5)
  DREAM_CLAUDE_BIN    claude executable to launch (default: claude)
  DREAM_CHILD         set on the launched session; makes `gate` a no-op, so a
                      dream can never start another dream
