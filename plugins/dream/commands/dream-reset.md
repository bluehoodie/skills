```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dream.py" reset
```

Show the output to the user. This also discards the memory snapshot, so the last
dream can no longer be undone with `/dream:dream-restore`. To reset *every*
project instead, remove
`$HOME/.claude/dream-plugin-state` entirely — confirm first, since that discards
every project's consolidation history.
