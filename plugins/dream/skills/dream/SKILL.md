  Memory consolidation. Synthesizes recent signal into durable memories, then
  reviews existing ones for staleness, duplication, bloat, and drift. Merges,
  prunes, and reindexes MEMORY.md. Use when the user says /dream, "dream", or
  asks to consolidate memory files, when memory feels cluttered, or when
  MEMORY.md exceeds ~150 lines.

# Dream: Memory Consolidation

You are performing a dream — a reflective pass over the memory files for this
project. Synthesize recent experience into durable, well-organized memories so
that future sessions can orient quickly without repeating discoveries.

The SessionStart hook runs this same skill in a headless Sonnet session when the
gates open, so these instructions have to work unattended. Do the work, then
report compactly.

## Paths

```bash
echo "$HOME/.claude/projects/$(pwd | sed 's|/|-|g')"
```

That directory holds this project's session transcripts — large JSONL files, to
be grepped narrowly and never read whole. Memory lives in its `memory/`
subdirectory, which already exists.

**Only write inside the memory directory.** A dream never modifies project code,
config, or anything else in the working tree.

## Phase 1 — Orient

1. `ls` the memory directory to see what already exists
2. Read `MEMORY.md` to understand the current index; note if over 150 lines
3. Skim existing topic files (first ~30 lines of each) to gauge coverage and
   freshness, so you improve them rather than creating duplicates
4. If `logs/` or `sessions/` subdirectories exist (assistant-mode layout), list
   them and review the most recent entries

## Phase 2 — Gather recent signal

Look for new information worth persisting. Sources in priority order:

1. **Daily logs** — `logs/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md` if present. This is the
   append-only stream and the richest source; read the entries added since the
   last consolidation.
2. **Existing memories that drifted** — facts that contradict what the codebase
   or git history shows now.
3. **Transcript search** — only when you need a specific detail you already
   suspect matters (e.g. "what was the error from yesterday's build failure?").
   Grep narrow terms:

   ```bash
   grep -rn "<narrow term>" <transcript-dir> --include="*.jsonl" | tail -50
   ```

   If the prompt that started this dream lists the transcripts new since the last
   one, those files are the ones worth searching — grep them by name instead of
   the whole directory, which also holds sessions an earlier dream already mined.

Do not exhaustively read transcripts. Look only for things you already suspect
matter.

## Phase 3 — Audit and consolidate

First audit **each** existing memory file:

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Staleness** | Does this fact still match the codebase? Grep/read to verify key claims. If wrong, update or delete. |
| **Duplication** | Do two files cover the same topic? Merge the pair. |
| **Bloat** | Is any MEMORY.md entry over ~200 chars? Demote it — move detail into the topic file, shorten the index line. |
| **Missing links** | Are there `[[name]]` references to memories that don't exist? Create the referenced memory or remove the dead link. |
| **Type drift** | Does `metadata.type` still match the content? (e.g. a "project" memory that's really "feedback") |
| **Date rot** | Any relative dates ("last week", "recently") that should be absolute? |

Then write the result, at the **top level** of the memory directory:

- **Persist new signal from Phase 2** as new memory files, or by merging it into
  the existing topic file it belongs to. Prefer merging — a near-duplicate is
  worse than a longer file.
- **Use the format and type conventions below.** That section is the source of
  truth for what to save, how to structure the frontmatter, and what NOT to save.
- **Fix stale facts** to match current code/git state. If a memory is entirely
  obsolete, delete the file.
- **Convert relative dates** to absolute dates, using today's date as reference.
- **Remove memories that violate the save rules** — code structure derivable by
  reading files, git history available via `git log`, fixes already visible in
  committed code, anything already in CLAUDE.md.
- **Fix type fields** and update descriptions to match current content.
- **Resolve contradictions** — trust current code over old memory.

## Phase 4 — Prune and index

Update `MEMORY.md`. It is an **index**, not a dump — never write memory content
into it.

- Each entry is one line under ~150 characters: `- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook`
- Stay under 200 lines total and under ~25KB
- Remove pointers to files that are now deleted, stale, wrong, or superseded
- Add pointers to memories created this pass
- Sort semantically by topic, not chronologically
- Verify every link target exists

## Memory file format

Each memory is ONE file holding ONE fact, with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: <short-kebab-case-slug>
description: <one-line summary - used to decide relevance during recall>
metadata:
  type: user | feedback | project | reference
---

<the fact; for feedback/project, follow with **Why:** and **How to apply:** lines.
 Link related memories with [[their-name]].>
```

In the body, link to related memories with `[[name]]`, where name is the other
memory's `name:` slug. Link liberally — a `[[name]]` that does not match an
existing memory yet is fine; it marks something worth writing later, not an
error.

Types:

- `user` — who the user is (role, expertise, preferences)
- `feedback` — guidance the user has given on how to work, both corrections and
  confirmed approaches; include the why
- `project` — ongoing work, goals, or constraints not derivable from the code or
  git history; convert relative dates to absolute
- `reference` — pointers to external resources (URLs, dashboards, tickets)

Before saving, check for an existing file that already covers it — update that
file rather than creating a duplicate; delete memories that turn out to be wrong.
Do NOT save what the repo already records (code structure, past fixes, git
history, CLAUDE.md) or what only matters to a single conversation.

## Rules

- Do NOT create memories about the current task or conversation — a dream
  consolidates past sessions, it does not journal this one
- Do NOT read full JSONL transcripts — grep narrowly for specific terms only
- If everything is already tight and nothing changed, say "Memory is clean — no
  changes needed" and stop
- Report in a few plain-text lines: files created, merged, updated, deleted, and
  index lines changed. No preamble, no restating the phases, no dumping file
  contents.
